# Waterbird #

Waterbird was the response to a 7 day game challenge. Unfortunately I'm not a student anymore, so that meant time grabbed during commuting and the weekend.

## Setup ##

Waterbird is written in ruby with the graphic framework ruby shoes. You can [download shoes](http://shoesrb.com/downloads "download shoes") which includes ruby, and then create a start script.

    here=`pwd`
    /path/to/shoes3.run.sh $here/waterbird.rb
